name: 'Graphs.Balance Dendrogram Help Menu'
description: 'This feature performs a Balance Dendrogram by means of a sequential binary partititon of selected parts. The way to selec the partition is the same as in Transformation-ILR-Raw routine.. To perform a zoom in a graph it is possible to use the slider scroll at the bottom of the graph or just using the scroll wheel of the mouse. It is also possible to rotate a figure by means of the left button of the mouse. Holding the left mouse button and moving it the graph rotates following the direction of the mouse. To move the graph inside the window holding the left mouse button and simultaneously holding the ALT key. Furthermore, the graphs can be saved by means of snapshots of what windows have each moment. This can be done with the menu $\\textbf{File-Save As}$. The same menu $\\textbf{File}$ includes a submenu $\\textbf{Configuration}$ that allows to customize the elements of the graph like lines and labels by means of changing size and colors. The menu $\\textbf{Data}$ allows to put names to the observations according to the values of a variable. The submenu $\\textbf{Add observation names}$ associates the variable that contain the names and submenu $\\textbf{Show observation names}$ print all names on the graph. Alternatively by double click over an observation the name appears/disappears.'
options:
  - Default partition: 'The default partition is defined by the Haar basis. It consists in separating, at each step, the parts approximately in the middle. For example, \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 0 \\end{array} shows the corresponding $+1$, $-1$ and $0$ codification of the default 3-part composition.'
  - Define Manually: 'Activating this option, a new button appears and clicking on it to show a new window. This window has a grid where rows represents parts and columns the steps of the partition. To define the partition, every time the user marks with a single click one part, a $+$ sign appears in the grid at the cell corresponding to this part in the current step. At each step of partition, a $+$ sign means that the part is assigned to the first group, a $-$ sign to the second, and it remains blank if this part is not in the group which is divided at this order. To remove a $+$ sign from the current step it is necessary to mark the cell of the current step of the partition grid that contains this $+$ sign with a single click. To finish a step, press the $\\textbf{Next Step}$ button. At each step it is only possible to divide one group. This group is marked with a green color on the partition grid. In order to facilitate this task, when the $\\textbf{Next Step}$ button is pressed, all the information (labels and partition) is reordered in such a way that the next parts to divide appear in a sequence. To eliminate some steps of the partition, press the $\\textbf{Previous Step}$ button as many times as required.'
  - add balances: 'If checked, this routine returns the ILR-transformed data (balances) into the data set.'
  - add statistics: 'If checked, this routine returns the mean and the variance of each balance.'
