name: 'Statistics.Additive Logistic Normality Tests Help Menu'
description: 'This function alows the user to perform a test for logistic normality of a $D$-part composition. It includes all marginal, univariate distributions (with a total of $(D-1)$ tests); all bivariate angle distributions (with a total of $D(D-1)/2$ tests); and the $(D-1)$-dimensional radius distribution. For each kind of test the Anderson-Darling, Cramer-von Misses and Watson statistics are computed and their significance is given.'
