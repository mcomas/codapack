name: 'Graphs.Ternary/Quaternary Plot Help Menu'
description: 'This feature displays a ternary diagram of three or four selected parts. Once the graph is produced it is possible to center de data into the ternary diagram and to draw a grid, the latest only on 2D graph. Also by means of two buttons is possible to interchange the parts of the vertices of the ternary. To perform a zoom in a graph it is possible to use the slider scroll at the bottom of the graph or just using the scroll wheel of the mouse. It is also possible to rotate a figure by means of the left button of the mouse. Holding the left mouse button and moving it the graph rotates following the direction of the mouse. If the graph is 2D then the figure just moves inside the windows without rotation. To move the graph inside the window holding the left mouse button and simultaneously holding the ALT key. Furthermore, the graphs can be saved by means of snapshots of what windows have each moment. This can be done with the menu $\textbf{File-Save As}$. The same menu $\textbf{File}$ includes a submenu $\textbf{Configuration}$ that allows to customize the elements of the graph like lines and labels by means of changing size and colors. The menu $\textbf{Data}$ allows to put names to the observations according to the values of a variable. The submenu $\textbf{Add observation names}$ associates the variable that contain the names and submenu $\textbf{Show observation names}$ print all names on the graph. Alternatively by double click over an observation the name appears/disappears.'
