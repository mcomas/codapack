description: 'This feature performs a discriminant analysis between the ILR transformed group of parts by means of a sequential binary partititon of selected parts and a categorical variable. The way to selec the partition is the same as in Transformation-ILR-Raw routine. The output of this routine includes the plot of residuals of each regression and the coefficients of each regression in a new data set.'
options:
  - Set X Partition: 'to define the sequential binary partition. There is two ways to do it $\\textbf{Default partition}$: The default partition is defined by the Haar basis. It consists in separating, at each step, the parts approximately in the middle. For example, \\begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & -1 & 0 \\end{array} shows the corresponding $+1$, $-1$ and $0$ codification of the default 3-part composition. And $\\textbf{Define Manually}$: Activating this option, a new button appears and clicking on it to show a new window. This window has a grid where rows represents parts and columns the steps of the partition. To define the partition, every time the user marks with a single click one part, a $+$ sign appears in the grid at the cell corresponding to this part in the current step. At each step of partition, a $+$ sign means that the part is assigned to the first group, a $-$ sign to the second, and it remains blank if this part is not in the group which is divided at this order. To remove a $+$ sign from the current step it is necessary to mark the cell of the current step of the partition grid that contains this $+$ sign with a single click. To finish a step, press the $\\textbf{Next Step}$ button. At each step it is only possible to divide one group. This group is marked with a green color on the partition grid. In order to facilitate this task, when the $\\textbf{Next Step}$ button is pressed, all the information (labels and partition) is reordered in such a way that the next parts to divide appear in a sequence. To eliminate some steps of the partition, press the $\\textbf{Previous Step}$ button as many times as required.' 
  - Use of uniform prior: 'If checked, this routine uses an uniform prior.'
  - Predicting for a new sample: 'If checked, this routine performs a prediction of new samples that should be in another data set.'
  - Discriminant scores: 'If checked, this routine returns the discriminant scores as new columns of the data set.'
  - Posterior prob. for the classes: 'If checked, this routine returns posterior probabilities for the classes.'
