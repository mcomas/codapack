name: Data.Manipulte.Discretize/Segment variable Help Menu
description: "This function implements several basic unsupervised methods to convert a continuous variable into a categorical variable (factor) using different binning strategies. For convenience, a whole data.frame can be discretized (i.e., all numeric columns are discretized). It uses R function $\mathbf{discretize}$ from package $\mathbf{arules}$."
