name: "Graphs.Biplot Help Menu"
description: "This feature performs a compositional biplot of selected parts. Biplot consists on the decomposition of clr matrix, $X = UDV'$. Once performed the graph the user could choose 1) which 2D view prefers (axes XY, YZ or XZ), and 2) which biplot display depending of $\alpha$ value. $\alpha = 0$ corresponds to a Covariance Biplot, $\alpha = 1$ Form Biplot, and $\alpha = 0.5$ Symmetric Scaling Biplot, which is the default value. To perform a zoom in a graph it is possible to use the slider scroll at the bottom of the graph or just using the scroll wheel of the mouse. It is also possible to rotate a figure by means of the left button of the mouse. Holding the left mouse button and moving it the graph rotates following the direction of the mouse. To move the graph inside the window holding the left mouse button and simultaneously holding the ALT key. Furthermore, the graphs can be saved by means of snapshots of what windows have each moment. This can be done with the menu $\mathbf{File-Save As}$. The same menu $\mathbf{File}$ includes a submenu $\mathbf{Configuration}$ that allows to customize the elements of the graph like lines and labels by means of changing size and colors. The menu $\mathbf{Data}$ allows to put names to the observations according to the values of a variable. The submenu $\mathbf{Add observation names}$ associates the variable that contain the names and submenu $\mathbf{Show observation names}$ print all names on the graph. Alternatively by double click over an observation the name appears/disappears."
options:
   - add coordinates: "If checked, this routine returns the Principal Components and the cumulative proportion explained of each component. Also the routine writes three on the data set the coordinates of the observations on the biplot."
