description: With this feature the data is transformed from the simplex (raw data) to real space ($ilr$ coordinates) with the isometric logratio transformation ($ilr$) defined by a sequential binary partition. The $ilr$ transformation consists on: $\mathbf{y} = ilr(\mathbf{x}) = \left(y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_{D-1} \right) \in \mathbb{R}^{D-1}$, where $y_i = \sum_{j=1}^D \psi{ij} \ln x_j \,,$ $i=1,2,\ldots,D-1$, and $\psi_{ij} = \left\{  \begin{array}{ll} \sqrt{\frac{s_i}{r_i(s_i+r_i)}}, \hbox{if at step $i$ the part $j$ is coded in the SBP as $+1$;} \\ -\sqrt{\frac{r_i}{s_i(s_i+r_i)}}, \hbox{if at step $i$ the part $j$ is coded in the SBP as $-1$;} \\ 0, \hbox{if at step $i$ the part $j$ is coded in the SBP as $0$;} \end{array} \right.$, with $r_i$ the number of parts coded at step $i$ in the SBP as $+1$, and $s_i$ the number of parts coded at step $i$ in the SBP as $-1$. \textbf{Definition of the partition:} A partition is a hierarchical grouping of parts of the original compositional vector, starting with the whole composition as a group and ending with each part in a single group. First, the compositional vector is divided into two non-overlapping groups of parts. In a similar way, each of these two groups is divided again, and so on until all groups contain only a single part. If $D$ is the number of parts of the original composition, the number of steps of the partition is $D-1$. CoDapack includes three different ways to define a partition: 1) The default partition, 2) Defined manually by the user, and 3) By means of paste (or write) a matrix of $+1$, $-1$ and $0$  that define the partition.
options:
  - Default partition: The default partition is defined by the Haar basis. It consists in separating, at each step, the parts approximately in the middle. For example, \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 1 & -1 \\ 1 & -1 & 0 \end{array} shows the corresponding $+1$, $-1$ and $0$ codification of the default 3-part composition.
  - Define Manually: Activating this option, a new button appears and clicking on it to show a new window. This window has a grid where rows represents parts and columns the steps of the partition. To define the partition, every time the user marks with a single click one part, a $+$ sign appears in the grid at the cell corresponding to this part in the current step. At each step of partition, a $+$ sign means that the part is assigned to the first group, a $-$ sign to the second, and it remains blank if this part is not in the group which is divided at this order. To remove a $+$ sign from the current step it is necessary to mark the cell of the current step of the partition grid that contains this $+$ sign with a single click. To finish a step, press the \emph{Next Step} button. At each step it is only possible to divide one group. This group is marked with a green color on the partition grid. In order to facilitate this task, when the \emph{Next Step} button is pressed, all the information (labels and partition) is reordered in such a way that the next parts to divide appear in a sequence. To eliminate some steps of the partition, press the \emph{Previous Step} button as many times as required.
