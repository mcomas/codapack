name: "Data.Irregular Data. Non-Parametric Zero Replacement Help Menu"
description: "This feature applies a transformation to the data to avoid zeros. Zero multiplicative replacement consists in substituting an observation $\\mathbf{x}\\,$, with zeros in some parts, by an observation $\\mathbf{y}$ using the expression: $y_i = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\\delta_i, & \\hbox{if $x_i = 0$;} \\\\x_i \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\sum_{x_j = 0} \\delta_j}{C_x} \\right), & \\hbox{if $x_i > 0$.} \\end{array} \\right.$ where $\\delta_i$ is the replacement value for the $i$-th part defined by the user and $C_x$ the components sum of observation $\\mathbf{x}$. $\\delta_i$ is the detection limit multiplied by the DL proportion constant. CoDaPack v2 differentiates missing and zero data. This menu applies to zero data. As it was seen on Set Detection Limit Menu there is an individual constant $\\delta_i$ for each non-detected value, that is stored on the data frame. It uses R function $\\textbf{multRepl}$ from package $\\textbf{zCompositions}$."
options:
  - DL Proportion: "Detection limit proportion."
  - Closure Result: "if activated, the data is closed to a constant."
  - Closure to: "Constant of closure, by default $1.0$. Only if Closure Result is activated."
