description: 'This feature computes principal balances from the selected compositional parts using different methods.'
options:
  - Method: 'Choose the method to compute principal balances. Options include: Exact (diagonalizes the log-ratio variance matrix), Constrained (approximates principal components under compositional constraints), and Cluster (uses Ward’s hierarchical clustering).'
  - Include balances in dataset: 'If checked, the resulting principal balances will be added as new columns to the current dataset.'
