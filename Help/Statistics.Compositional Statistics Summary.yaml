name: 'Statistics.Compositional Statistics Summary Help Menu'
description: 'This menu produces two types of descriptive statistics: the first related to logratios (Variation Array, CLR variance and Total Variance) and the second related to compositional descriptive statistics (Centre, Min, Max and quartiles).'
options: 
  - Center: 'Returns the centre of the data set, that is, $\\hat \\xi = C[g_1, g_2, \\ldots, g_D ]$, where $g_i = \\left(\\prod_{k=1}^N x_{ki} \\right)^{1/N}$ stands for the geometric mean of part $X_i$ in data set $\\mathbf{X}$. The data set $\\mathbf{X}$ has been previously closed.'
  - Percentile: 'For each part of the data set $\\mathbf{X}$ it returns the percentiles of the closed data set. If activated percentiles must be separates by blank spaces.'
  - Variation Array: 'Returns a matrix where the upper diagonal contains the logratio variances and the lower diagonal contains the logratio means. That is, the $ij$-th component of the upper diagonal is $\\left[ \\ln(X_i / X_j) \\right]\\,,$ and the $ij$-th component of the lower diagonal is $[\\ln(X_i/ X_j)]\\,,$ where $i,j=1,2,\\ldots,D\\,.$ The output of the routine includes a color classification of the logratio variances (elements of the upper diagonal of Variation Array). It is assumed that the logarithm of the logratio variances follow a t-student distribution, then dark blue colores those elements below percentile 5, light blue from percentile 5 to 25, light red form percentiles 75 to 95 and dark red up to percentile 95. This option also returns $\\textbf{CLR Variances:}$ for each part, the sum of logratio variances that involve it. Thus, for the $i$-th $clr$ component $\\xi_i$ we have $(\\xi_i) = \\frac{1}{D} \\sum_{j=1, i\\neq j}^D \\left[\\ln\\left(X_i/X_j\\right) \\right]$.' 
  - Total Variance: 'Returns the Total Variance. The sum of all clr Variances is the Total Variance totvar.'
