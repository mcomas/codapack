description: "This function transfors the data with the additive logratio transformation \(alr\). In the \(alr\) transformation the divisor is taken to be the last part according to the sequence selected by the user. The interface allows the user to reorder the variable once they have been selected just by dragging its name in the selected data list. Recall that \(alr\) coordinates depend on the divisor, and that they conform an oblique basis."
options:
  - Raw-ALR: "Transformation from the simplex (raw data) to real space ($alr$ coordinates),$$ %\mathbf{y} = alr(\mathbf{x}) = \left[\ln \frac{x_1}{x_D}, \ln\frac{x_2}{x_D}, \ldots, \ln \frac{x_{D-1}}{x_D}\right]\,, %$$ %where $\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{D-1}$, the $(D-1)$-dimensional real space."
  - ALR-Raw: "Transformation from the real space ($alr$ coordinates) to the simplex (raw data), $$ %\mathbf{x} = agl(\mathbf{y}) = \left[\frac{\exp(y_1)}{1+\sum_{i=1}^{D-1} \exp{y_i}}, \ldots,\frac{\exp(y_{D-1})}{1+\sum_{i=1}^{D-1} \exp{y_i}},\frac{1}{1+\sum_{i=1}^{D-1} \exp{y_i}} \right]\,,$$ %"
