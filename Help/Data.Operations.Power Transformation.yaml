description: "With this feature applies a power transformation to the data \citep{Ait86}. For $a\in \mathbb{R}\,,$ the power transformation returns $a \otimes x = C \left[ x_1^a, x_2^a, \ldots, x_D^a \right] $."
options:
  - Power: "the constant of the operation."
  - Closure Result: "if activated, the data is closed to a constant."
  - Closure to: "Constant of closure, by default $1.0$. Only if Closure Result is activated."
