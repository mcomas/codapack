description: "This function transforms the data with the centred logratio transformation ($clr$). Recall that the $clr$ coordinates represent a generating system, not a basis, and therefore $clr$ coordinates sum up to zero. As a consequence, covariances and correlations between $clr$-parts have the same drawbacks as covariances and correlations between compositional parts: they are not subcompositionally coherent."
options:
  - Raw-CLR: "Transformation from the simplex (raw data) to real space ($clr$ coordinates), $\mathbf{y} = clr(\mathbf{x}) = \left[\ln \frac{\mathbf{x}}{g_D(\mathbf{x})}\right] = \left[\ln \frac{x_1}{g_D(\mathbf{x})}, \ln \frac{x_2}{g_D(\mathbf{x})},\ldots,\ln \frac{x_D}{g_D(\mathbf{x})}\right]$, where $\mathbf{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{D-1}$ and $g_D(\mathbf{x})$ is the geometric mean of the parts involved, i.e. $g_D(\mathbf{x}) = \left( \prod_{i=1}^D x_i \right)^{1/D} = \exp \left( \frac{1}{D} \sum_{i=1}^D \ln x_i \right)$"
  - CLR-Raw: "Transformation from the real space ($clr$ coordinates) to the simplex (raw data), $\mathbf{x} = clr^{-1}(\mathbf{y}) = \left[\frac{\exp(y_1)}{\sum_{i=1}^D \exp{y_i}},\frac{\exp(y_2)}{\sum_{i=1}^D \exp{y_i}}, \ldots,\frac{\exp(y_D)}{1+\sum_{i=1}^D \exp{y_i}},\right]$."
