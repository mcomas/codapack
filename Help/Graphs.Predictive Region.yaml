name: Graphs.Predictive Region Help Menu
description: This feature displays a ternary diagram of three selected parts with the predictive(s) region(s) of $1-\alpha$ according to the additive logistic Normal Distribution. Once the graph is produced it is possible to center de data into the ternary diagram and to draw a grid. Also by means of two buttons is possible to interchange the parts of the vertices of the ternary. To perform a zoom in a graph it is possible to use the slider scroll at the bottom of the graph or just using the scroll wheel of the mouse. Holding the left mouse button and moving it the graph moves inside the windows. Furthermore, the graphs can be saved by means of snapshots of what windows have each moment. This can be done with the menu \emph{File-Save As}. The same menu \emph{File} includes a submenu \emp{Configuration} that allows to customize the elements of the graph like lines and labels by means of changing size and colors. The menu \emph{Edit} allows to put observation (submenu \emph{Add data set}), straight coda lines (submenu \emph{Add coda straight lines}) and curves (submenu \emph{Add curve}).
options:
  - Predicion level: definition of $1-\alpha$. It is possible to give more than one value, in this case separated by blank spaces. The deffault value is $0.90$ $0.95$ $0.99$.
